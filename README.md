# First GitHub Project

It took a while to get used to but this is the first project that i've pushed to a remote repository using Git and GitHub.

## Technologies Used

In this project we used some simple HTML5 and CSS3 to build the project, we wrote our code using the Cloud9 IDE, and we've backed it up using Git and GitHub

# First GitHub Project

It took a while to get used to but this is my first project that i've created and pushed to a remote repository using Git and GitHub.

## Technologies Used

In this project we used HTML5 and CSS3 to build the project, we wrote our code using the Cloud9 IDE, and we've backed it up using Git and GitHub
